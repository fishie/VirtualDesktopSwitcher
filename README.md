# VirtualDesktopSwitcher for Windows 10

Are you like me and have been using the mouse scroll to switch between virtual desktops on GNU/Linux for years? Do you like to keep your hand in your pants while still being able to easily switch between virtual desktops? Then this program might be for you.

Finally virtual desktops have come to Windows! Hallelujah! But, virtual desktops in Windows 10 are somewhat lacking in functionality compared to the well established virtual desktops in the GNU/Linux world. Sooner or later Microsoft will probably introduce more functionality but in the meantime this project attempts to amend some of what is lacking.
